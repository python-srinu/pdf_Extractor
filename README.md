# PDF Text Extraction and Question-Answering with BERT

This project demonstrates a practical application of **NLP** (Natural Language Processing) using **transformers** and **PyPDF2** libraries to extract text from a PDF and answer questions based on the extracted content. As an aspiring data scientist, this project was an exciting opportunity to expand my skills in working with real-world data, leveraging transformer models, and applying deep learning to automate information extraction.

## Project Overview

This Python-based tool is designed to:

- **Extract text** from PDF files.
- **Answer specific questions** about the text content using a BERT model fine-tuned on SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset).

The project utilizes **PyPDF2** for PDF text extraction and **Hugging Face's Transformers** library with a BERT-based question-answering pipeline. The result is a simple yet powerful utility that can help retrieve precise information from document-based sources.

## Motivation

Understanding how to utilize deep learning for language processing is critical in the field of data science. By applying BERT for question-answering, this project showcases my ability to integrate various tools and techniques to solve real-world problems, demonstrating my growth in the areas of NLP, transformers, and Python automation.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction:** Reads PDF files and extracts text from each page.
- **Question-Answering with BERT:** Answers natural language questions based on the extracted text.

## Future Improvements

- Extend support for multilingual PDFs.
- Add more advanced document preprocessing for better QA results.
- Experiment with different transformer models for enhanced accuracy.
